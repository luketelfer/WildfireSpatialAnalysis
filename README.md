# Wildfire Spatial Analysis

Compute burn severity spatial metrics for historical wildfires occurring in three HUC-8 watersheds of the Boise River headwaters and explore the distributions of the chosen metrics.  This is to facilitate the creation of the synthetic "experimental" burn severity mosaics for use in modeling watershed-scale hydrologic impacts of wildfire with ParFlow-CLM.  Includes MTBS thematic burn severity geotiffs; documentation (PyLandStats, fire information, conda environment); landscape metrics data; and Jupyter Notebooks containing calculations and figures.
